# Progress Update: 2025-05-21

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Architecture Design
- Designed comprehensive architecture for the trading simulator
- Created component breakdown with clear separation of concerns
- Defined key interfaces for all system components
- Planned data flow between components

### 2. Data Model Definition
- Created data models for candles, symbols, timeframes, and metadata
- Implemented validation for data integrity
- Added serialization/deserialization support

### 3. WebSocket Implementation
- Designed WebSocket server using Gorilla WebSocket library
- Created subscription mechanism for candle data
- Implemented connection management and error handling
- Added message routing for commands and candle data

### 4. Simulation Controller
- Designed simulator engine with configurable tick intervals
- Implemented simulation clock for time management
- Added support for multiple timeframes (daily/hourly)
- Created listener interface for candle data broadcasts

### 5. HTTP API Design
- Designed RESTful API for simulator control
- Created endpoints for starting, stopping, pausing, and resuming simulations
- Added support for changing simulation speed and skipping to specific times
- Implemented error handling and validation

### 6. Integration Testing
- Created integration tests with WebSocket connections
- Implemented configurable intervals (daily candles every 5 seconds, hourly every 1 second)
- Verified correct candle emission ordering and timing
- Added logging for candle data to verify functionality

### 7. Code Quality & Linting
- Fixed import path issues (marekmajdak â†’ marekm1844)
- Fixed nil pointer dereference issues in simulation clock
- Improved concurrency safety with proper locking
- Added comprehensive error handling

## Implementation Details

### Data Flow
- Historical price data is loaded from files in the data/ directory
- Data is cached in memory for efficient access
- Simulation clock triggers candle emissions at configured intervals
- Candles are broadcast to WebSocket clients and other listeners

### Configuration
- Daily candles can be streamed every 5 seconds (configurable)
- Hourly candles can be streamed every 1 second (configurable)
- Simulation can be started from a specific date
- Simulation speed can be adjusted on the fly

### API Control
- Simulation can be controlled via HTTP endpoints
- Commands include: start, stop, pause, resume, skip, set speed
- WebSocket clients can also send commands and receive candle data

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Implementation of Data Provider**
   - Implement file-based data provider
   - Add support for loading and parsing JSON candle data
   - Add caching mechanisms for performance

2. **Finalize Simulator Engine**
   - Implement full time progression with speed control
   - Add smarter candle emission based on timeframes
   - Enhance error handling and edge cases

3. **Complete WebSocket Server**
   - Finish client subscription handling
   - Add authentication and security measures
   - Enhance error recovery mechanisms

4. **Build HTTP API Server**
   - Implement all designed endpoints
   - Add validation for requests
   - Implement proper error responses

5. **Create Sample Client**
   - Build a simple client that connects to the simulator
   - Demonstrate candle data streaming
   - Show simulator control via API
